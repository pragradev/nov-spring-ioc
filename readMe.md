Bean life cycle: create, initialize (init, prep), preparing to destroy (predestroy), destroy

customization 1,2
xml files(beans)
--> @Configuration annotation / properties heavy
--
@Conponent annotation -> service/ BO/ 

--> Honda, other classes, String, lists, map, set

Exercise 2025-02-27:

@Component
@COmponentScan(use different package)
